# Mini project 1, Dataset 1: Wage


# Auxiliary variables:
Wage <- read_excel("Wage.xlsx")
df <- data.frame(Wage)
wage_col <- Wage$wage
health_ins_col <- Wage$health_ins


# Part (a): Hypothesis test

# Step 0: check assumptions

# Check assumption: normal distribution

# Shapiro test for normality
# After running the following line, we see that the p-value < 0.05, therefore
# showing proving the population's normality:
shapiro.test(wage_col)

# Step 1/2: Null and Alternative Hypotheses

# H_0: The variance of wages for those with health insurance is the same as
#      for those who do not have health insurance.
# H_A: The variance of wages for those with health insurance is NOT the same as
#      for those who do not have health insurance.

# Step 3/4: Finding the Test Statistic
# After running the following line, we can see the p-value is 1.812e-06
var.test(wage_col ~ health_ins_col, data = df)

# Step 5: Conclusion

# At alpha = 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, as 1.812e-06 < 0.05. There is
# enough evidence to claim that the variance of wages for those with health insurance
# is NOT the same as for those who do not have health insurance.


# Part (b): One-factor ANOVA test

# Step 0: Assumptions

# We assume that the population of the workers is approximately normal with
# equal variance.

# Step 1/2: Null and Alternative hypotheses

# H_0: The mean wages are equal across all education levels
# H_A: There are at least two means that are different.

# Step 3/4: Finding the Test Statistic
# After running the following line, we see that the p-value is <2e-16
ts_oneway <- aov(wage ~ education, data = df)
summary(ts_oneway)

# Step 5: Conclusion

# At alpha = 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, as <2e-16 < 0.05. There is
# sufficient evidence that there are at least two mean wages that are different.
